As you can see, the game requires at least 6 GB of RAM to run properly. But what if you have only 4 GB of RAM on your PC? Does that mean you can't play Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare at all? Not necessarily. There are some tricks and tweaks that you can try to make the game run on your low-end PC. Here are some of them:
 
## Lower the Graphics Settings
 
The first and most obvious thing you can do is to lower the graphics settings of the game. This will reduce the load on your RAM and improve your FPS (frames per second). To do this, go to the Options menu in the game and select Graphics. Then, adjust the following settings:

- Texture Resolution: Low
- Texture Filtering: Low
- Shadow Map Resolution: Low
- Shadow Caster Levels: Low
- Anti-Aliasing: Off
- Ambient Occlusion: Off
- Motion Blur: Off
- Depth of Field: Off
- Tessellation: Off
- Cached Sun Shadow Maps: Off
- Cached Spot Shadow Maps: Off
- Volumetric Lighting Quality: Off
- Particle Lighting Quality: Low
- Fur and Smoke Quality: Low
- Subsurface Scattering Quality: Low
- Anisotropic Filtering Quality: Low
- Supersampling Quality: Off
- Filmic Strength: Off
- Film Grain Amount: Off

You can also disable the Extra Details option in the Advanced tab. This will remove some of the unnecessary objects and effects from the game world.
  
## Use a Config File
  
A config file is a text file that contains various commands and settings that affect the game's performance and behavior. You can use a config file to tweak some of the hidden options that are not available in the game's menu. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a new text file and name it config.cfg.
2. Open the file with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. Copy and paste the following commands into the file:
