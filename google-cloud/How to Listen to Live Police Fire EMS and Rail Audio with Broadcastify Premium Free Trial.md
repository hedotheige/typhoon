In this article, we will show you some examples of how you can use Mecaflux Standard for your fluid mechanics projects. Mecaflux Standard has a variety of functions and tools that can help you with different aspects of fluid mechanics, such as:

- Calculating the lift and drag of profiles in external flows
- Calculating the major and minor head losses and pressure drops in internal flows
- Sizing ducts, pumps and turbines in fluid networks
- Editing and searching for fluids and pumps
- Graphical analysis of network performance and operating costs

Let's see how you can use some of these functions in practice.
 
## Calculating the lift and drag of profiles in external flows
 
If you are designing a wing, a sail, a hydrofoil or any other object that interacts with a fluid flow, you need to know the lift and drag forces that act on it. Lift is the force that pushes the object perpendicular to the flow direction, while drag is the force that opposes the flow direction. The lift and drag coefficients are dimensionless numbers that characterize the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic performance of the object.
 
Mecaflux Standard allows you to calculate the lift and drag coefficients of any profile shape by using a panel method. A panel method is a numerical technique that divides the profile into small panels and solves the potential flow equations around them. Mecaflux Standard has a library of predefined profiles that you can choose from, or you can create your own profile by entering the coordinates of the points that define its shape.
 
To calculate the lift and drag coefficients of a profile, you need to enter the following data:

- The fluid properties (density and viscosity)
- The flow conditions (velocity and angle of attack)
- The profile shape (predefined or custom)
- The number of panels (more panels give more accuracy but take more time)

Once you enter these data, Mecaflux Standard will display the results in a table and a graph. You can also see the pressure distribution and the streamlines around the profile. You can change any parameter and see how it affects the results. You can also compare different profiles and see which one has the best performance for your design.
